        <p>Design a platform to complete this process at a very simplistic level. This should contain a
form / page whereby a user can capture all the information in 1., upload 2 and 3 and save.
All the information saved should be stored in a database allowing the manager to access a
separate form/page once saved to review the payment requisition and sign off on this. By
pressing sign the cover page should be created in pdf reflecting all the captured information
together with managerâ€™s pre-stored signature.</p>
